## The Story Behind This App

Actually this repository is a fork of the [original Writer](https://launchpad.net/writer). One day I found the original one and was very impressed, but it doesn't seems to be updated recently and doesn't released to AppCenter. Then I feel I want to fork it and develop.

So this repository would not exist without the work of the original developers Tuur Dutoit, Anthony Huben and [its mockup designer](https://www.deviantart.com/spiceofdesign/art/Writer-Concept-351501580) spiceofdesign.
